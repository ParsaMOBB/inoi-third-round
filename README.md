# INOI Third Round Exam Solutions (Iranian National Olympiad in Informatics)

This repository contains my solutions to the **Third Round** (`مرحله ۳`) problems from the **32nd Iranian National Olympiad in Informatics (INOI)** (`دوره ۳۲`). I may update this repository in the future to include solutions from other years if I am able to access them.

All solutions are written in **C++**, as it's the preferred language in INOI.

> Note: Some files use `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, which is supported by many online judges and common compilers, but may not work in all environments. If you encounter issues, consider including standard libraries individually instead.

## Compilation & Execution

You can compile and run the solutions using a C++ compiler like `g++`. For example:

```bash
g++ -std=c++13 file_name.cpp -o file_name
./file_name
````

If you're using Linux or macOS, you can also provide input from a test file:

```bash
./file_name < path/to/test.in
```

Test files for each problem (organized by day) are located in the `resources/` directory.

## Video Solutions

I have also created video explanations for the **32nd Third Round exam** and more. These are available on **[GreenOly](https://greenoly.org/c/%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%87-3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AF-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%BE%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B1)** — a platform focused on Olympiad training. You can visit their website to access and purchase the full **Third Round** course. The course is presented in **Farsi**.
